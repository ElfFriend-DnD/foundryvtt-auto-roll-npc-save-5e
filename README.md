Adds a chat card that is only visible for GMs that checks if an NPC who was targeted with something requiring a saving throw succeeds or fails that save.

If there is no token targeted when the attack roll is rolled, no chat card is output.

Compatible with:
- Minimal Rolling Enhancements
- Better Rolls 5e

If you're using Midi, this is already entirely possible without this module. Do not use this with that.

To power this module up even more, pair it with a module that targets tokens when a measured template is dropped, e.g. DF QOL.
